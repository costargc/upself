It was developed at University of Pennsylvania in 1946.","categories":["computers"]},{"response":"You could say that the very first, primitive computer was the Jacquard Loom, which was a programmable loom that used punchcards to store the patterns it made.  This made it a reprogrammable mechanical device.","categories":["computers"]},{"response":"An integrated circuit that implements the functions of a central processing unit of a computer.","categories":["computers"]},{"response":"A really small circuit which stores instructions and performs calculations for the computer.","categories":["computers"]},{"response":"The heart of the computer, to put it simply.","categories":["computers"]},{"response":"The brain of a computer, to put it simply.","categories":["computers"]},{"response":"An electronic component in which all of the parts are part of a contiguous silicon chip, instead of discrete components mounted on a larger circuit board.","categories":["computers"]},{"response":"Software that coordinates between the hardware and other parts of the computer to run other software is called an operating system, or the OS.","categories":["computers"]},{"response":"Windows, MacOS, Linux, UNIX... all of them are types of OSes.","categories":["computers"]},{"response":"Android and iOS are operating systems for mobile devices.","categories":["computers"]},{"response":"Software which implements the basic functions of a computer, such as memory access, processes, and peripheral access.","categories":["computers"]},{"response":"It depends on which machine you're using to talk to me!","categories":["computers"]},{"response":"I'd prefer to not hurt your feelings.","categories":["computers"]},{"response":"Linux, always Linux!","categories":["computers"]},{"response":"What are you trying to accomplish.
